When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with other contributors, it is useful to keep it in a remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

branch is to create another workflow in the same repository, cloning is to copy the entire repository while forks are only for github in cloning repositories. branch is for adding new features and etc. Cloning is to start work on an existing repository. Forking is to copy an existing repository on github and work on it in your own remote repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This is so that when pulling or fetching from the remote repository, merge conflicts can be addressed. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Not sure what would be easier but what would be harder is merging different codes and getting people to understand the changes.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would want to make changes in a seperate branch when working with other people so that other people can verify my work and do their own testing, give comments, then finally merge it into master when it goes well.
